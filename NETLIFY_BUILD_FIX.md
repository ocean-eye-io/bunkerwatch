# Netlify Build Fix - Dependency Resolution

## Problem
Build failed due to TypeScript version conflict:
- `typescript@5.7.2` (devDependency)
- `react-scripts@5.0.1` expects `typescript@^3.2.1 || ^4`

## Solution

### 1. Downgraded TypeScript Version
**File:** `package.json`
```json
"typescript": "^4.9.5"  // Changed from "5.7.2"
```

### 2. Created Netlify Configuration
**File:** `netlify.toml`
- Added `NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"` environment variable
- Configured PWA headers and caching
- Set Node version to 22

### 3. Created NPMRC Configuration
**File:** `.npmrc`
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

## What This Does

### `.npmrc`
- Automatically uses `--legacy-peer-deps` for all npm install commands
- Works locally and on Netlify

### `netlify.toml`
- Configures Netlify build settings
- Sets NPM_FLAGS environment variable for the build
- Configures proper caching for PWA assets
- Ensures service worker and manifest are not cached

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add package.json netlify.toml .npmrc
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify build dependencies"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify will automatically rebuild** with the fix

3. **Expected result:**
   - Build succeeds with compatible TypeScript version
   - npm install uses --legacy-peer-deps automatically
   - PWA assets are properly cached/uncached

## Testing Locally

After pushing, test locally:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # Should work now
npm run build                    # Should build successfully
```

## Alternative if Issue Persists

If Netlify still has issues, you can explicitly set the install command in Netlify dashboard:
- **Build command:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
