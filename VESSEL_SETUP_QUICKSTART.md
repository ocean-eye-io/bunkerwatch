# ðŸš¢ BunkerWatch Vessel Setup - Quick Start

## Goal
Get vessel names showing in the dropdown and enable offline data downloads.

## âœ… Status Check

Before proceeding, verify you've completed:

- [x] Database migration `004_link_eva_istanbul_to_vessel_id.sql` (you confirmed this is done)
- [ ] Lambda handler updated with new vessel endpoints
- [ ] Database performance indexes added (recommended)
- [ ] Frontend tested with vessel dropdown

---

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Verify Database Setup

Run this query in your PostgreSQL/RDS to confirm everything is ready:

```sql
-- Check vessel exists and is active
SELECT vessel_id, vessel_name, imo_number, active 
FROM vessels 
WHERE LOWER(vessel_name) = LOWER('Eva Istanbul');
```

**Expected output:**
```
vessel_id | vessel_name  | imo_number  | active
----------|--------------|-------------|-------
    1     | Eva Istanbul | IMO9876543  | t
```

If vessel doesn't exist or `active = f`, run:
```sql
UPDATE vessels SET active = true WHERE vessel_name = 'Eva Istanbul';
```

### Step 2: Verify Data Linkage

Confirm compartments have vessel_id set:

```sql
-- Check compartments are linked to vessel
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_compartments,
    vessel_id,
    (SELECT vessel_name FROM vessels WHERE vessel_id = c.vessel_id) as vessel
FROM compartments c
GROUP BY vessel_id;
```

**Expected output:**
```
total_compartments | vessel_id | vessel
-------------------|-----------|-------------
        10         |     1     | Eva Istanbul
```

If `vessel_id` is NULL, re-run migration `004_link_eva_istanbul_to_vessel_id.sql`.

### Step 3: Update Lambda Handler

**Option A: AWS Console (Quick)**
1. Go to AWS Lambda Console
2. Open your function
3. Replace `index.js` with code from: `lambda/bunkerwatch-enhanced-handler.js`
4. Click **Deploy**
5. Test with the URL

**Option B: AWS CLI**
```bash
cd lambda
zip function.zip bunkerwatch-enhanced-handler.js
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name YOUR_LAMBDA_NAME \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

**Important Lambda Settings:**
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds (for data package generation)
- **Memory:** 512 MB (recommended)
- **VPC:** Same VPC as your RDS instance

### Step 4: Test New Endpoints

Test vessel list endpoint:
```bash
curl https://YOUR-LAMBDA-URL.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/vessels
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "vessel_id": 1,
      "vessel_name": "Eva Istanbul",
      "imo_number": "IMO9876543",
      "vessel_type": "Container Ship",
      "flag_state": "Malta"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### Step 5: Test Frontend

1. **Open BunkerWatch app** (should already be running on http://localhost:3000)
2. **Enter Lambda URL** in the connection screen
3. **Click "Connect"**
4. **You should see:** Vessel selection screen with "Eva Istanbul" in dropdown
5. **Select vessel** and click "Download Vessel Data"
6. **Wait** for download to complete (5-10 seconds)
7. **Success!** You should see vessel dashboard with tank list

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Dropdown is empty (no vessels)

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check Lambda response
curl https://YOUR-LAMBDA-URL/vessels

# Check browser console (F12)
# Look for network errors or CORS issues
```

**Fixes:**
1. Verify Lambda URL is correct
2. Check CORS headers in Lambda response
3. Verify database connection (check CloudWatch logs)
4. Ensure vessel is `active = true` in database

### Issue 2: "Vessel not found" error

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Ensure vessel exists and is active
INSERT INTO vessels (vessel_name, imo_number, vessel_type, flag_state, active)
VALUES ('Eva Istanbul', 'IMO9876543', 'Container Ship', 'Malta', true)
ON CONFLICT (vessel_name) DO UPDATE SET active = true;
```

### Issue 3: "No compartments found for this vessel"

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check if compartments have vessel_id
SELECT compartment_id, compartment_name, vessel_id 
FROM compartments 
LIMIT 5;

-- If vessel_id is NULL, link them:
UPDATE compartments 
SET vessel_id = (SELECT vessel_id FROM vessels WHERE vessel_name = 'Eva Istanbul')
WHERE vessel_id IS NULL;
```

### Issue 4: Download fails or times out

**Causes:**
- Lambda timeout (increase to 30-60 seconds)
- Large dataset (add performance indexes)
- Database connection issues

**Fixes:**
```bash
# Increase Lambda timeout
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name YOUR_LAMBDA_NAME \
  --timeout 60

# Add performance indexes (see Step 6 below)
```

### Issue 5: CORS error in browser console

**Fix:** Ensure Lambda has CORS headers:
```javascript
const headers = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS'
};
```

This is already in the `bunkerwatch-enhanced-handler.js`.

---

## âš¡ Step 6: Add Performance Indexes (Recommended)

This will make data package downloads **5-10x faster**.

```bash
# Connect to your RDS instance
psql -h YOUR-RDS-ENDPOINT -U your-user -d your-database

# Run the index migration
\i migrations/005_add_performance_indexes.sql
```

Or copy-paste from `migrations/005_add_performance_indexes.sql` into your SQL client.

**Impact:**
- Data package generation: 5-10s â†’ 1-2s
- Vessel queries: 500ms â†’ 10-50ms
- Duplicate checks: 100ms â†’ 5-10ms

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

1. âœ… Vessel dropdown shows "Eva Istanbul"
2. âœ… Clicking "Download Vessel Data" completes successfully
3. âœ… You see tank list after download
4. âœ… Sounding calculations work offline (turn off internet and test)
5. âœ… Sync status shows "0 pending items"

---

## ðŸ“Š What Happens Next

Once vessel data is downloaded:

1. **Offline Mode:** 
   - All tank sounding calculations work without internet
   - Data stored in browser's IndexedDB
   - Calibration data loaded from local storage

2. **Recording Data:**
   - Sounding logs saved locally with `sync_status: 'pending'`
   - Works completely offline

3. **Sync Back Online:**
   - When internet returns, click "Sync Now"
   - Pending logs upload to Lambda â†’ RDS
   - Duplicate detection prevents double entries

---

## ðŸš€ Next Features to Implement

After vessel selection works:

1. **Multiple Vessels Support**
   - Add more vessels to database
   - Switch between vessels
   - Download multiple vessel packages

2. **Bunkering Monitor**
   - Real-time fuel intake monitoring
   - Multiple bunker support
   - Time-series calculations

3. **Reporting**
   - Daily sounding reports
   - Fuel consumption analysis
   - Historical trends

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Keep Lambda Warm:** 
   - Set reserved concurrency to 1-2 instances
   - Or use EventBridge to ping every 5 minutes

2. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Check CloudWatch logs for query timing
   - Look for slow queries (> 500ms)
   - Add indexes as needed

3. **Backup Strategy:**
   - Regular RDS snapshots (daily recommended)
   - Export vessel data packages to S3
   - Test restore procedures

4. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Use RDS Proxy for better connection pooling
   - Cache data packages in S3 (future enhancement)
   - Monitor Lambda invocations and optimize
