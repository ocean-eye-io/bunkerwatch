# üîß URL Fix Applied - Vessel Dropdown Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified

Your Lambda URL had a **trailing slash**, causing the API calls to have **double slashes**:

```
‚ùå https://o4lrsr4fhkcpq3lktyqvk335n40fxmin.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws//vessels
                                                                        ^^
                                                                   double slash
```

This caused the Lambda to return **500 Internal Server Error** instead of vessel data.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Files Updated:

1. **`src/db/dataPackageService.js`**
   - Added `normalizeLambdaUrl()` function to strip trailing slashes
   - Updated `fetchVessels()` to normalize URLs
   - Updated `downloadVesselDataPackage()` to normalize URLs
   - Updated `checkForDataUpdates()` to normalize URLs
   - Added better error logging to show Lambda error details

2. **`src/db/syncService.js`**
   - Added `normalizeLambdaUrl()` function
   - Updated `syncSoundings()` to normalize URLs
   - Updated `syncBunkering()` to normalize URLs

### What it does:
```javascript
// Before fix:
lambdaUrl: "https://....on.aws/"
Result:    "https://....on.aws//vessels"  ‚ùå

// After fix:
lambdaUrl: "https://....on.aws/"
Normalized: "https://....on.aws"
Result:    "https://....on.aws/vessels"   ‚úÖ
```

## üß™ Next Steps - Testing

### 1. Refresh Your Browser

The app should automatically reload. If not:
- Press `Ctrl+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+R` (Mac)
- Or hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`

### 2. Check Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for:
```
Fetching vessels from: https://o4lrsr4fhkcpq3lktyqvk335n40fxmin.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws/vessels
```

Make sure there's **no double slash** (`//vessels` ‚Üí `/vessels`)

### 3. Test the Vessel Dropdown

You should now see:
- ‚úÖ "Eva Istanbul" appears in the vessel dropdown
- ‚úÖ No 500 error in console
- ‚úÖ Download button becomes enabled when you select the vessel

## üö® If Still Getting 500 Error

The URL fix is done, but if you're **still getting 500 errors**, it means your Lambda has an issue:

### Test Your Lambda Directly:

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
curl https://o4lrsr4fhkcpq3lktyqvk335n40fxmin.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws/vessels
```

**If you see:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "count": 1
}
```
‚úÖ Lambda is working! Just refresh browser.

**If you see:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "...",
  "message": "..."
}
```
‚ùå Lambda has an error. See "Common Lambda Issues" below.

---

## üîç Common Lambda Issues (if still 500)

### Issue 1: Lambda Code Not Updated

**Symptom:** 
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Route not found",
  "available_routes": ["GET /compartments", "POST /sounding"]
}
```

**Fix:** Deploy the new Lambda code from `lambda/bunkerwatch-enhanced-handler.js`

---

### Issue 2: Database Connection Failed

**Symptom:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Database connection failed"
}
```

**Fixes:**
1. Check Lambda is in the **same VPC** as your RDS
2. Check RDS **security group** allows Lambda's security group
3. Verify **environment variables** (DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)
4. Check RDS is **running** and accessible

---

### Issue 3: No Active Vessels in Database

**Symptom:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

**Fix:** Run this SQL:
```sql
-- Check if vessel exists
SELECT * FROM vessels WHERE vessel_name = 'Eva Istanbul';

-- If not active, activate it:
UPDATE vessels SET active = true WHERE vessel_name = 'Eva Istanbul';

-- If doesn't exist, create it:
INSERT INTO vessels (vessel_name, imo_number, vessel_type, flag_state, active)
VALUES ('Eva Istanbul', 'IMO9876543', 'Container Ship', 'Malta', true)
ON CONFLICT (vessel_name) DO UPDATE SET active = true;
```

---

### Issue 4: Compartments Not Linked to Vessel

**Symptom:** Data package download fails with "No compartments found"

**Fix:** Run migration again:
```bash
psql -h YOUR_RDS_HOST -U your_user -d your_db -f migrations/004_link_eva_istanbul_to_vessel_id.sql
```

## üìä Debugging Tools Created

### 1. **`lambda/TEST_LAMBDA_ENDPOINTS.md`**
Complete testing guide with:
- curl commands to test each endpoint
- SQL queries to verify database
- CloudWatch log checking
- Step-by-step troubleshooting

### 2. **Browser Console Logging**
The app now logs:
```javascript
Fetching vessels from: https://...
Vessels fetched successfully: [...]
```

Or if error:
```javascript
Error fetching vessels: HTTP 500: Internal Server Error - Database connection failed
```

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior (Working)

### 1. Open BunkerWatch App
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Enter Lambda URL
```
https://o4lrsr4fhkcpq3lktyqvk335n40fxmin.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws
```

Or with trailing slash (both work now):
```
https://o4lrsr4fhkcpq3lktyqvk335n40fxmin.lambda-url.ap-south-1.on.aws/
```

### 3. Click "Connect"
- ‚úÖ Shows "Vessel Selection" screen
- ‚úÖ Dropdown has "Eva Istanbul"
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

### 4. Select Vessel & Download
- ‚úÖ Download completes in 5-10 seconds
- ‚úÖ Shows tank list after download
- ‚úÖ Can calculate soundings offline

---

## üìù Quick Checklist

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] Browser refreshed (Ctrl+R)
- [ ] Console shows correct URL (no `//vessels`)
- [ ] Lambda test with curl returns success
- [ ] Database has active vessels
- [ ] Compartments have vessel_id set
- [ ] Vessel dropdown populates
- [ ] Download works
- [ ] Calculations work

---

## üöÄ What's Next After Fix

Once vessels are showing in the dropdown:

1. **Select "Eva Istanbul"**
2. **Click "Download Vessel Data"**
3. **Wait for download** (shows progress)
4. **Test offline mode:**
   - Disconnect internet
   - Try a sounding calculation
   - Should work without internet!

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Save Lambda URL
The app remembers your Lambda URL in localStorage, so you only need to enter it once.

### Check Console Regularly
Keep browser console open (F12) during testing to see:
- API calls being made
- Response status codes
- Any errors

### Monitor Lambda
Check CloudWatch logs while testing to see:
- What requests Lambda receives
- Database query performance
- Any errors on the backend

---

## üìû Still Stuck?

If vessel dropdown still doesn't work after:
1. ‚úÖ Refreshing browser
2. ‚úÖ Confirming no double slash in console
3. ‚úÖ Testing Lambda with curl (works)

Then provide:
1. **Screenshot** of browser console (F12)
2. **Output** of curl test
3. **Results** of SQL verification queries
4. **Lambda CloudWatch logs** (last 5 minutes)

---

## Summary

**Problem:** Double slash in API URL (`//vessels`)  
**Cause:** Lambda URL had trailing slash  
**Fix:** Added URL normalization in frontend services  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed  

**Next:** Refresh browser and test vessel dropdown!
